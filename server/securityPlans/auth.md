Security Plan for /auth Endpoints
Endpoints

POST /api/auth/register: Registers a new user with email, password, name.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticates with email and password, returns JWT.
POST /api/auth/google: Authenticates via Google OAuth, returns JWT.
GET /api/auth/me: Returns current user’s data (protected).

Environment

Hosted on Render (Node.js, HTTPS default), MongoDB, GA4 for client-side pageviews/events via gtag.
JWTs stored in localStorage, Render environment variables for JWT_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.

Security Focus

Exploits: API abuse, brute-forcing, injection, session theft (XSS), credential stuffing, data exposure.
Standards: OWASP API Security Top 10 (Broken Authentication, BOLA, Excessive Data Exposure, Security Misconfiguration, Logging Failures).

POST /api/auth/register
Approach 1: Rate Limiting with Input Validation (Recommended)

Description: Limit requests to 10/hour per IP with express-rate-limit. Validate email (domain, no disposables), name (3-50 chars), password (complexity). Sanitize inputs with express-validator.
Effectiveness: Mitigates API abuse, injection, brute-forcing (OWASP API1, API6).
Alternative: Google reCAPTCHA for anti-bot protection.
Why Better: Stronger against bots, but adds client-side integration.


Pros:
Prevents API abuse, injection.
Render-compatible.
Stronger validation.


Cons:
Needs Redis/in-memory store.
IP limiting affects shared IPs.
CAPTCHA adds friction.



Approach 2: Secure Session Management with Error Handling

Description: Use 15-minute JWTs, HTTPS, generic errors (“Registration failed”), log attempts via Winston.
Effectiveness: Mitigates session theft, data exposure (OWASP API2, API3).
Alternative: HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies for JWTs.
Why Better: Prevents XSS-based token theft.


Pros:
Short-lived tokens reduce risks.
Generic errors prevent enumeration.
HTTPS is Render default.


Cons:
Token refresh impacts UX.
Cookies need CSRF protection.
Logging adds setup.



Approach 3: Logging Security Events with Database Query Monitoring

Description: Log attempts with Winston, monitor MongoDB queries (>100ms), send failures to GA4.
Effectiveness: Detects brute-forcing, slow queries (OWASP API8).
Alternative: Datadog for real-time monitoring.
Why Better: Advanced analytics, but costly.


Pros:
Detects attack patterns.
GA4 leverages existing setup.
Query monitoring.


Cons:
Logging/profiling overhead.
GA4 needs custom events.
Detection-based.



POST /api/auth/login
Approach 1: Rate Limiting with Input Validation (Recommended)

Description: Limit to 20/hour per IP, validate/sanitize inputs, implement 15-minute lockout after 5 failed attempts.
Why Recommended: Directly prevents brute-forcing, credential stuffing (OWASP API2).
Effectiveness: Limits login attempts, prevents injection, user enumeration.
Alternative: CAPTCHA after failed attempts.
Why Better: Blocks bots, but adds friction.


Pros:
Mitigates brute-forcing.
Generic errors prevent enumeration.
Render-compatible.


Cons:
IP limiting affects shared IPs.
Lockout needs storage.
CAPTCHA impacts UX.



Approach 2: Secure Session Management with Error Handling

Description: Use 15-minute JWTs, HTTPS, generic errors (“Invalid credentials”), log failures.
Effectiveness: Mitigates session theft, data exposure (OWASP API2, API3).
Alternative: HttpOnly cookies for JWTs.
Why Better: Prevents XSS token theft.


Pros:
Short-lived tokens.
Generic errors.
HTTPS default.


Cons:
Token refresh impacts UX.
Cookies need CSRF protection.
Logging setup.



Approach 3: Logging Security Events with Database Query Monitoring

Description: Log attempts, monitor MongoDB queries (>100ms), send failures to GA4.
Effectiveness: Detects brute-forcing, slow queries (OWASP API8).
Alternative: Datadog for monitoring.
Why Better: Advanced analytics, but costly.


Pros:
Detects attacks.
GA4 integration.
Query monitoring.


Cons:
Logging/profiling overhead.
GA4 needs custom events.
Detection-based.



POST /api/auth/google
Approach 1: Rate Limiting with Input Validation (Recommended)

Description: Limit to 50/hour per IP, validate Google token, sanitize user data.
Why Recommended: Prevents API abuse, ensures secure OAuth (OWASP API1, API6).
Effectiveness: Limits token verification abuse, prevents injection.
Alternative: Google OAuth 2.0 client-side verification.
Why Better: Reduces server load, but needs client changes.


Pros:
Prevents API abuse.
Validates tokens/data.
Render-compatible.


Cons:
Needs Redis/in-memory store.
IP limiting affects shared IPs.
Client-side OAuth complex.



Approach 2: Secure Session Management with Error Handling

Description: Use 15-minute JWTs, HTTPS, generic errors (“Authentication failed”), log attempts.
Effectiveness: Mitigates session theft, data exposure (OWASP API2, API3).
Alternative: HttpOnly cookies for JWTs.
Why Better: Prevents XSS token theft.


Pros:
Short-lived tokens.
Generic errors.
HTTPS default.


Cons:
Token refresh impacts UX.
Cookies need CSRF protection.
Logging setup.



Approach 3: Logging Security Events with Database Query Monitoring

Description: Log attempts, monitor MongoDB queries (>100ms), send failures to GA4.
Effectiveness: Detects abuse, slow queries (OWASP API8).
Alternative: Datadog for monitoring.
Why Better: Advanced analytics, but costly.


Pros:
Detects attacks.
GA4 integration.
Query monitoring.


Cons:
Logging/profiling overhead.
GA4 needs custom events.
Detection-based.



GET /api/auth/me
Approach 1: Rate Limiting with Input Validation

Description: Limit to 100/hour per user ID/IP, validate JWT and userId, restrict response fields.
Effectiveness: Mitigates API abuse, data exposure (OWASP API1, API3).
Alternative: Cloudflare WAF for rate limiting.
Why Better: Offloads rate limiting, adds DDoS protection.


Pros:
Prevents API abuse.
Validates tokens.
Render-compatible.


Cons:
Needs Redis/in-memory store.
IP limiting affects shared IPs.
WAF adds cost.



Approach 2: Secure Session Management with Error Handling (Recommended)

Description: Use 15-minute JWTs, HttpOnly cookies, HTTPS, generic errors, log failures.
Why Recommended: Prevents XSS-based token theft (OWASP API2), critical for localStorage usage.
Effectiveness: Mitigates session theft, data exposure (OWASP API2, API3).
Alternative: Refresh tokens with server-side sessions.
Why Better: More robust, but complex for Render.


Pros:
HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS.
Short-lived tokens.
HTTPS default.


Cons:
Cookie storage needs client/server changes.
CSRF protection required.
Refresh tokens complex.



Approach 3: Logging Security Events with Database Query Monitoring

Description: Log requests, monitor MongoDB queries (>100ms), send failures to GA4.

Alternative: Datadog for monitoring.
Why Better: Advanced analytics, but costly.


Pros:
Detects attacks.
