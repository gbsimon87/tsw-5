Environment

Hosted on Render (Node.js, HTTPS default), MongoDB, GA4 for client-side pageviews/events via gtag.
JWTs in localStorage, Render environment variables for JWT_SECRET.
Middleware: authMiddleware (JWT validation) for all endpoints; checkAdminOrManager for POST, PATCH endpoints.

Security Focus

Exploits: API abuse (DoS), injection (teamId, leagueId, secretKey), unauthorized access, session theft (XSS), data exposure (team/player data).
Standards: OWASP API Security Top 10 (Broken Authentication, BOLA, Excessive Data Exposure, Security Misconfiguration, Logging Failures).

GET /api/teams/
Recommended Approach: Rate Limiting with Input Validation

Description: Limit requests to 100/hour per user ID/IP with express-rate-limit. Validate leagueId (ObjectId), season (non-empty string). Restrict response fields. Log invalid attempts.
Implementation Steps:
Apply express-rate-limit for 100/hour per user ID/IP.
Validate leagueId, season with express-validator.
Filter response to exclude sensitive fields (e.g., members.player.user.email).
Log invalid attempts via Winston.


Effectiveness: Prevents API abuse, injection, data exposure (OWASP API1, API3, API6).
Alternative: Cache responses in Redis.
Why Better: Improves performance, but rate limiting prioritized.


Pros:
Prevents abuse, injection.
Reduces data exposure.
Render-compatible.


Cons:
Needs Redis.
IP limiting affects shared IPs.
Response filtering needs care.

POST /api/teams/join
Recommended Approach: Rate Limiting with Input Validation

Description: Limit requests to 50/hour per user ID/IP. Validate secretKey (32-char hex string). Sanitize inputs. Log invalid attempts and send to GA4.
Implementation Steps:
Use express-rate-limit for 50/hour per user ID/IP.
Validate secretKey with express-validator.
Sanitize inputs.
Log invalid attempts via Winston and send to GA4.


Effectiveness: Prevents API abuse, brute-forcing, injection, data exposure (OWASP API1, API3, API6).

Additional Notes

Non-Default Database Ports: If MongoDB is self-hosted on Render, change port from 27017 to a non-standard port (e.g., 27018) and restrict access via Render’s firewall. Not applicable for MongoDB Atlas.
Session Management: JWTs in localStorage are vulnerable to XSS. HttpOnly cookies could enhance security for authenticated endpoints, but require client-side changes.
API Versioning: Less critical for stable /teams endpoints, but versioning (e.g., /api/v1/teams) can be added for future-proofing.
