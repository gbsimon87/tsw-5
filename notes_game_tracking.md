To implement play-by-play stat tracking in the `GameTracking` application, we need a system that records each stat event with its associated game time and period, supports editing existing stats, and integrates with the existing game object structure. Since you’ve indicated that a clock component and period selector will eventually be added, and we need to account for games that may already have stats, let’s think through the best approach to achieve this. The goal is to enable detailed, time-stamped stat tracking while ensuring compatibility with the current `GameTracking`, `PlayerSelection`, and `BoxScore` components, as well as the provided game schema. We’ll also consider updates to the game model to support this feature.

### **Key Requirements**
1. **Play-by-Play Stat Tracking**:
   - Record each stat event (e.g., twoPointFGM, assist, personalFoul) with:
     - Player ID
     - Stat type (from `league.settings.statTypes`, e.g., twoPointFGM, threePointFGM, freeThrowM, assist, personalFoul)
     - Game time (e.g., seconds remaining in the period)
     - Period (e.g., 1st half, 2nd half, or overtime)
   - Allow adding new stats during the game.
   - Support editing or deleting existing stats (e.g., for corrections during or after the game).
   - Aggregate stats for display in `PlayerSelection` (personal fouls, points, assists) and `BoxScore` (all stats).

2. **Clock and Period Selector**:
   - Implement a clock component to track game time (e.g., counting down from `game.gameDuration` or per period).
   - Include a period selector to indicate the current period (e.g., halves for basketball, as per `league.settings.periodType`).
   - Associate each stat event with the current time and period.

3. **Game Object Updates**:
   - Update the game schema to store play-by-play data, including time and period for each stat event.
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing `playerStats` for aggregated stats.
   - Support saving and retrieving play-by-play data via API calls.

4. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - `GameTracking`: Manage clock state, period state, and stat recording.
   - `PlayerSelection`: Allow stat entry for active players, possibly via buttons or a modal.
   - `BoxScore`: Display aggregated stats, potentially with a play-by-play view.
   - Handle existing stats (e.g., from `game.playerStats`) during edits.

5. **User Experience**:
   - Provide an intuitive interface for stat entry (e.g., select player, stat type, confirm with current time/period).
   - Use `react-toastify` for feedback (e.g., “Stat recorded”, “Stat undone”).
   - Support undo functionality for recent stat entries.
   - Ensure performance for real-time updates during the game.

### **Analysis of Current State**
- **Game Schema**:
  - `playerStats` stores aggregated stats per player:
    ```javascript
    playerStats: [{
      player: ObjectId, // References Player
      team: ObjectId,   // References Team
      stats: {          // Aggregated counts
        twoPointFGM: Number,
        threePointFGM: Number,
        freeThrowM: Number,
        personalFoul: Number,
        assist: Number,
        ...
      }
    }]
    ```
  - No time or period information is stored, so it’s not suitable for play-by-play tracking.
  - `teamScores` is derived from `playerStats` using `league.settings.scoringRules` in the `pre('save')` hook.
  - `gameDuration` (e.g., 48 minutes) and `league.settings.periodType` (e.g., “halves”) provide context for clock and period structure.

- **GameTracking Component**:
  - Manages `formData.playerStats` as an object mapping `playerId` to aggregated stats (e.g., `{ [playerId]: { twoPointFGM: 1, assist: 1 } }`).
  - `handleStatIncrement` adds stats to `formData.playerStats` and supports undo via `lastChange`.
  - `handleSave` sends aggregated stats to the backend via `axios.patch`.
  - No clock or period tracking currently.

- **PlayerSelection Component**:
  - Displays active players with stats preview (personal fouls, points, assists) using `game.playerStats`.
  - Supports substitutions with checkboxes.

- **BoxScore Component** (assumed, not provided):
  - Displays `game.playerStats` filtered by team or all players, sorted by name.
  - Likely needs to show aggregated stats and possibly a play-by-play log.

### **Proposed Approach**
Let’s break this down into steps to address play-by-play stat tracking, clock, period selection, and game model updates, considering both new games and edited games with existing stats.

#### **1. Update Game Schema for Play-by-Play Data**
To support play-by-play tracking, we need to store each stat event with its timestamp and period. Instead of relying solely on `playerStats` for aggregated counts, we’ll add a `playByPlay` array to the game schema to store individual events. The `playerStats` array can remain for aggregated stats, updated via a `pre('save')` hook to ensure consistency.

- **Proposed Schema Change**:
  Add a `playByPlay` field:
  ```javascript
  playByPlay: [{
    player: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Player', required: true },
    team: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Team', required: true },
    statType: { type: String, required: true }, // e.g., twoPointFGM, assist
    period: { type: String, required: true },   // e.g., "1st Half", "2nd Half", "OT1"
    time: { type: Number, required: true },    // Seconds remaining in period (e.g., 720 for 12:00 in a half)
    timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now }, // Real-world timestamp for audit
  }]
  ```
  - `player` and `team` link to the respective models.
  - `statType` is validated against `league.settings.statTypes`.
  - `period` indicates the game period (e.g., “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, “OT1” for overtime).
  - `time` stores seconds remaining in the period (e.g., 720 for 12:00 in a 12-minute half).
  - `timestamp` tracks when the stat was recorded for auditing.

- **Update pre('save') Hook**:
  - Aggregate `playByPlay` entries into `playerStats` by counting occurrences of each `statType` per `player`.
  - Recalculate `teamScores` based on `playerStats` and `league.settings.scoringRules`.
  - Validate that `playByPlay` entries reference valid teams and stat types.

- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - For existing games with `playerStats` but no `playByPlay`, allow editing aggregated stats directly.
  - When saving, convert new `playByPlay` entries to `playerStats` for consistency.
  - Optionally, allow importing existing `playerStats` into `playByPlay` with default time/period for edits (e.g., assign to “Unknown” period or last period).

#### **2. Implement Clock Component**
A clock component is essential for associating stats with the correct game time. Since `league.settings.periodType` is “halves” and `league.settings.periodDuration` is 24 minutes (1440 seconds), the clock should manage time per period and support overtime.

- **Clock Features**:
  - Display a countdown timer starting at `league.settings.periodDuration * 60` seconds (e.g., 1440 seconds for 24 minutes).
  - Allow starting, pausing, and resetting the clock (e.g., for timeouts or period ends).
  - Track the current period (e.g., “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, “OT1”, “OT2”).
  - Emit the current time (seconds remaining) and period for stat recording.
  - Support manual adjustments for editing games (e.g., set time to a specific value).

- **State Management**:
  - Add `clockState` (e.g., { running: boolean, seconds: number, period: string }) to `GameTracking`.
  - Initialize `seconds` from `league.settings.periodDuration * 60` and `period` from `league.seasons` or default to “1st Half”.
  - Update `seconds` every second when running, resetting at period changes.

- **UI Placement**:
  - Place the clock above or within the `ScoreBoard` component for visibility.
  - Include buttons for start/pause and period selection (e.g., dropdown or tabs for “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, “OT1”).

#### **3. Implement Period Selector**
The period selector allows users to specify the current period for stat entries, supporting the game’s structure (e.g., halves for basketball).

- **Period Selector Features**:
  - Display options based on `league.settings.periodType` (e.g., “1st Half”, “2nd Half” for halves).
  - Allow adding overtime periods dynamically (e.g., “OT1”, “OT2”).
  - Sync with the clock to reset time when changing periods (e.g., 1440 seconds for a new half).
  - Persist the current period in `GameTracking` state.

- **State Management**:
  - Store `currentPeriod` in `GameTracking` (e.g., “1st Half”).
  - Update `clockState.period` when the user selects a new period.
  - Validate period against `league.settings.periodType` and game progress.

- **UI Placement**:
  - Integrate with the clock component (e.g., dropdown next to the clock).
  - Ensure clear feedback when switching periods (e.g., toast or visual highlight).

#### **4. Stat Entry Workflow**
To record play-by-play stats, users should select a player, choose a stat type, and record it with the current time and period.

- **Stat Entry Process**:
  - In `PlayerSelection`, add buttons or a modal for each player card to select stat types (e.g., “2PT”, “3PT”, “FT”, “Assist”, “Foul”).
  - On stat selection, record:
    - `playerId`: From the selected player.
    - `teamId`: From the player’s team.
    - `statType`: From the chosen stat (e.g., `twoPointFGM`).
    - `period`: From `currentPeriod`.
    - `time`: From `clockState.seconds`.
  - Store in a local `playByPlay` state in `GameTracking`.
  - Update `formData.playerStats` to reflect aggregated stats for immediate display.

- **Editing Existing Stats**:
  - Load `game.playByPlay` into `GameTracking` state on fetch.
  - Allow users to view and delete individual `playByPlay` entries (e.g., via a play-by-play log in `BoxScore`).
  - Support undoing recent stat entries via `lastChange`.
  - For games with only `playerStats`, allow adding new `playByPlay` entries or editing aggregated stats directly.

- **UI Considerations**:
  - Add stat buttons to `PlayerSelection` for active players in `rosters` mode.
  - Use a modal or dropdown for stat selection to avoid cluttering the UI.
  - Show a confirmation toast (e.g., “Assist recorded for Player X at 12:34 in 1st Half”).
  - Provide a play-by-play log in `BoxScore` to review and edit entries.

#### **5. Integration with Existing Components**
- **GameTracking**:
  - Manage `clockState`, `currentPeriod`, and `playByPlay` state.
  - Pass `clockState` and `currentPeriod` to the clock component.
  - Update `handleStatIncrement` to record `playByPlay` entries with time and period.
  - Modify `handleSave` to send `playByPlay` and `playerStats` to the backend.

- **PlayerSelection**:
  - Add stat entry controls (e.g., buttons for common stats like 2PT, 3PT, Foul).
  - Use `activePlayerId` or direct player selection for stat recording.
  - Update stats preview (PF, PTS, AST) in real-time based on `formData.playerStats`.

- **BoxScore**:
  - Display aggregated stats from `formData.playerStats`.
  - Add a tab or section for a play-by-play log, showing time, period, player, and stat type.
  - Allow deletion of `playByPlay` entries for editing.

- **ScoreBoard**:
  - Integrate the clock component for visibility.
  - Update team scores in real-time based on `formData.score`, derived from `playByPlay` and `league.settings.scoringRules`.

#### **6. Handling Existing Stats**
- **Loading Existing Games**:
  - On load, fetch `game.playByPlay` (if available) and initialize `playByPlay` state.
  - If only `playerStats` exists, display aggregated stats and allow adding new `playByPlay` entries.
  - For editing, populate `playByPlay` with estimated time/period for existing `playerStats` (e.g., assign to “2nd Half” or prompt user).

- **Editing Workflow**:
  - Allow users to add new `playByPlay` entries with the clock and period selector.
  - Support deleting or modifying `playByPlay` entries via `BoxLazy loading seems to be working correctly now, and the player stats are displayed as expected in the `PlayerSelection` component. The goal is to implement play-by-play stat tracking, ensuring each stat event is associated with a game time and period, while supporting games that may already have aggregated stats in `playerStats`. Since you’ve indicated that a clock component and period selector will be added, we need to plan how these integrate with stat tracking, update the game schema, and ensure compatibility with existing components. Let’s think through the approach, focusing on the requirements and constraints without providing code yet.

### **Key Requirements**
1. **Play-by-Play Stat Tracking**:
   - Record each stat event (e.g., `twoPointFGM`, `assist`, `personalFoul`) with:
     - Player ID
     - Stat type (from `league.settings.statTypes`, e.g., `twoPointFGM`, `assist`)
     - Game time (e.g., seconds remaining in the period)
     - Period (e.g., “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, “OT1”)
   - Support adding new stats during the game.
   - Allow editing or deleting existing stats for corrections.
   - Aggregate stats for display in `PlayerSelection` (personal fouls, points, assists) and `BoxScore` (all stats).

2. **Clock and Period Selector**:
   - Implement a clock to track game time, likely counting down from `league.settings.periodDuration` (e.g., 24 minutes per half).
   - Include a period selector to specify the current period (e.g., “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, overtime).
   - Associate each stat event with the current time and period.

3. **Game Object Updates**:
   - Update the game schema to store play-by-play data with time and period.
   - Maintain `playerStats` for aggregated stats, ensuring backward compatibility.
   - Support API updates for play-by-play data.

4. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - `GameTracking`: Manage clock, period, and stat recording.
   - `PlayerSelection`: Enable stat entry for active players.
   - `BoxScore`: Display aggregated stats and optionally a play-by-play log.
   - Handle existing `playerStats` for edited games.

5. **User Experience**:
   - Provide intuitive stat entry (e.g., buttons or modal for stat types).
   - Use `react-toastify` for feedback (e.g., “Stat recorded”, “Stat undone”).
   - Support undo functionality for recent stat entries.
   - Ensure performance for real-time updates.

### **Analysis of Current State**
- **Game Schema**:
  - `playerStats` stores aggregated stats:
    ```javascript
    playerStats: [{
      player: ObjectId, // References Player
      team: ObjectId,   // References Team
      stats: {          // Aggregated counts
        twoPointFGM: Number,
        threePointFGM: Number,
        freeThrowM: Number,
        personalFoul: Number,
        assist: Number,
        ...
      }
    }]
    ```
  - No time or period information, unsuitable for play-by-play.
  - `teamScores` is calculated from `playerStats` in the `pre('save')` hook using `league.settings.scoringRules`.
  - `gameDuration` (48 minutes) and `league.settings.periodType` (“halves”) inform clock and period structure.

- **GameTracking Component**:
  - Manages `formData.playerStats` as `{ [playerId]: { twoPointFGM: 1, assist: 1 } }`.
  - `handleStatIncrement` adds stats to `formData.playerStats` with undo via `lastChange`.
  - `handleSave` sends aggregated stats to the backend.
  - No clock or period tracking.

- **PlayerSelection Component**:
  - Displays active players with stats preview (personal fouls, points, assists) from `game.playerStats`.
  - Supports substitutions with checkboxes.

- **BoxScore Component** (assumed):
  - Displays `game.playerStats` filtered by team or all players.
  - Could show a play-by-play log.

### **Proposed Approach**
Here’s a step-by-step plan to implement play-by-play stat tracking, clock, and period selector, ensuring compatibility with existing stats.

#### **1. Update Game Schema**
To support play-by-play tracking, add a `playByPlay` field to store individual stat events with time and period, while keeping `playerStats` for aggregated stats.

- **New Field**:
  ```javascript
  playByPlay: [{
    player: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Player', required: true },
    team: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Team', required: true },
    statType: { type: String, required: true },
    period: { type: String, required: true }, // e.g., "1st Half", "2nd Half", "OT1"
    time: { type: Number, required: true },  // Seconds remaining in period
    timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  }]
  ```

- **Schema Updates**:
  - Update `pre('save')` to aggregate `playByPlay` into `playerStats` (count `statType` per `player`).
  - Recalculate `teamScores` from `playerStats`.
  - Validate `statType` against `league.settings.statTypes` and `team` against `game.teams`.

- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - For games with only `playerStats`, allow editing via aggregated stats or convert to `playByPlay` with default time/period (e.g., “2nd Half”).
  - Ensure API endpoints support both `playByPlay` and `playerStats`.

#### **2. Clock Component**
- **Functionality**:
  - Countdown from `league.settings.periodDuration * 60` (e.g., 1440 seconds for 24 minutes).
  - Support start, pause, and reset controls.
  - Track current period (e.g., “1st Half”).
  - Allow manual time adjustments for editing games.

- **State**:
  - Add `clockState: { running: boolean, seconds: number, period: string }` to `GameTracking`.
  - Initialize `seconds` from `league.settings.periodDuration * 60` and `period` to “1st Half”.

- **UI**:
  - Place in `ScoreBoard` or as a standalone component.
  - Display MM:SS format (e.g., 12:34).
  - Include buttons for start/pause and period selection.

#### **3. Period Selector**
- **Functionality**:
  - Options: “1st Half”, “2nd Half”, “OT1”, “OT2”, etc., based on `league.settings.periodType`.
  - Reset clock when changing periods.
  - Allow dynamic overtime additions.

- **State**:
  - Store `currentPeriod` in `GameTracking`.
  - Sync with `clockState.period`.

- **UI**:
  - Dropdown or tabs next to the clock.
  - Highlight current period.

#### **4. Stat Entry Workflow**
- **Process**:
  - In `PlayerSelection`, add buttons (e.g., “2PT”, “Foul”, “Assist”) for active players in `rosters` mode.
  - Record stat with:
    - `playerId`, `teamId`, `statType`, `period` (from `currentPeriod`), `time` (from `clockState.seconds`).
  - Store in `playByPlay` state in `GameTracking`.
  - Update `formData.playerStats` for real-time display.

- **Editing**:
  - Load `game.playByPlay` into state.
  - Allow deletion of `playByPlay` entries via `BoxScore` log.
  - Support manual stat entry with custom time/period for corrections.

- **UI**:
  - Buttons or modal for stat selection in `PlayerSelection`.
  - Toast feedback for each stat recorded.
  - Undo via `lastChange`.

#### **5. Integration**
- **GameTracking**:
  - Manage `playByPlay` state.
  - Update `handleStatIncrement` to add to `playByPlay`.
  - Modify `handleSave` to send `playByPlay` and `playerStats`.

- **PlayerSelection**:
  - Add stat entry controls.
  - Update stats preview in real-time.

- **BoxScore**:
  - Show aggregated stats and play-by-play log.
  - Allow editing/deleting entries.

#### **6. Handling Existing Stats**
- **Loading**:
  - Fetch `game.playByPlay` and `game.playerStats`.
  - If only `playerStats`, allow aggregated edits or convert to `playByPlay`.

- **Editing**:
  - Support adding new `playByPlay` entries.
  - Allow deletion via `BoxScore` log.
  - Recalculate `playerStats` and `teamScores` on save.

### **Best Approach**
1. **Start with Schema Update**:
   - Add `playByPlay` to store time-stamped events.
   - Update `pre('save')` to aggregate into `playerStats`.
   - Ensure API supports `playByPlay`.

2. **Implement Clock and Period Selector**:
   - Build a `Clock` component for countdown and period selection.
   - Manage state in `GameTracking`.
   - Place in UI for visibility.

3. **Enhance Stat Entry**:
   - Add stat buttons in `PlayerSelection`.
   - Record `playByPlay` entries with time and period.
   - Update `formData.playerStats` for display.

4. **Update BoxScore**:
   - Add play-by-play log view.
   - Support editing/deleting entries.

5. **Handle Existing Stats**:
   - Load `playByPlay` or fall back to `playerStats`.
   - Allow conversions for editing.

### **Considerations**
- **Clock Accuracy**: Ensure clock syncs with real-time updates and handles pauses correctly.
- **Performance**: Optimize `playByPlay` storage to handle many events (e.g., thousands in a game).
- **Editing UX**: Provide a clear interface for correcting stats without disrupting flow.
- **Validation**: Ensure stat types match `league.settings.statTypes`.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Should we prioritize the clock and period selector first, or focus on the stat entry mechanism and schema update? Any specific preferences for the UI or editing workflow?
